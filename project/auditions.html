  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>Bus Stop is a drama, with romantic and comedic elements. It is set in a diner in 
  rural Kansas in early March 1955, about 25 miles west of Kansas City, Missouri. A freak 
  snowstorm has halted the progress of the bus, and the eight characters (five from the 
  bus) have a weather-enforced layover in the diner from approximately 1 to 5 a.m. 
  Romantic or quasi-romantic relationships ensue between Grace and Carl, Professor Lyman 
  and Elma and Cherie and Bo. Virgil and Will are the older authority figures outside 
  the relationships.</p>
  <h3>Cast:</h3>
  <h4>Grace Hoylard</h4>
  <p>Owner of the diner, a "grass widow". She is fortyish, and pretty in a fading, hard-bitten way. She has a passionate side to her nature, loving a good fight and the attentions of a good man.</p>
  <h4>Elma Duckworth</h4>
  <p>An intelligent, but naive and impressionable high school girl (16 to 18). She is Grace's waitress.</p>
  <h4>Will Masters</h4>
  <p>The local sheriff (35 to 60). Tough as nails and brusque in manner, but goodhearted and a staunch Christian, described as a "deacon of his church". A highly "moral" man in the general sense of the word.</p>
  <h4>Dr. Gerald Lyman</h4>
  <p>A college philosophy professor (35 to 45) who is articulate and charming but cannot hold a position, partially due to his resistance to any kind of authority, and partially due to his unfortunate taste for young women. He also has an obvious drinking problem.</p>
  <h4>Cherie</h4>
  <p>A pretty young woman (25 to 30) who comes from a difficult "hill folk" background, and has left her innocence far behind. She is an aspiring nightclub singer, but has never worked in any establishment above the level of "cheap dive".</p>
  <h4>Bo Decker</h4>
  <p>A brash young cowboy (25 to 30) with boorish manners that hide a naivete almost as profound as Elma's. He has convinced himself that Cherie will be his bride, though Cherie wants nothing to do with him.</p>
  <h4>Virgil Blessing</h4>
  <p>An older (40 to 60), wiser cowboy who has become a father figure to Bo (who was orphaned at the age of ten) as well as Bo's head ranch hand.</p>
  <h4>Carl</h4>
  <p>The bus driver (30 to 45), who has an ongoing "just passing through" relationship with Grace. As referenced repeatedly, this is purely sexual in nature. He even attempts to touch Grace with his erection, which she considered flattering.</p>
